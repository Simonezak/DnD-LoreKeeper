# **Dungeons & Dragons – Lore Keeper** 
*Project for "Programmazione Java per Dispositivi Mobili" delivered in June 2023.*

*Dungeons & Dragons – Lore Keeper* is an Android application developed in **Java** using **Android Studio**, designed as a tool for tabletop role-playing players. The app allows users to manage D&D campaigns, track notes, roll dice, and organize character sheets in one unified interface.

This repository includes both the Android application source code and the backend, implemented using **Java Servlets** and connected to a **relational database**. Configuration parameters are defined in the *AndroidManifest.xml* file. The project uses fragments and follows the *Single-Activity design pattern* for modularity and navigation.

Additionally, the repository contains SQL scripts for database creation and population, as well as a presentation used to introduce the project.
